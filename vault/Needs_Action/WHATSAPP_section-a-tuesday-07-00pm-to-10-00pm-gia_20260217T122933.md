 Hackathon 2, Final Submission (Phases 2, 3, 4 & 5)



Hackathon 2 was announced on 26 December, and sufficient time has already been given for preparation and development.

 This weekend (Saturday–Sunday), 8–9 February, students are required to submit Hackathon 2 Phases 2, 3, 4, and 5.

 We are assuming:

You have already completed the implementation

You now only need to finalize and submit your work

No new development phase is starting — this is submission time

 What You Need to Do

Submit Phases 2, 3, 4, and 5 using the same Hackathon 2 submission form

If you already submitted Phase 1 earlier, simply edit your existing response

If you completed phases earlier, you may submit immediately

 Deadline

Sunday night, 9 February — 11:59 PM (strict)…
