# Post Content

🚀 Excited to share that I'm building my own Personal AI Employee as part of a hackathon!

Using Claude Code as the reasoning engine and Obsidian as the dashboard — the AI monitors Gmail, WhatsApp, and LinkedIn autonomously.

The future of work is here. What tasks would you automate first?
